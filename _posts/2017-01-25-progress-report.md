<span class="drobpcap">A</span>fter taking a moment to consider the project and share ideas with a few colleagues, I have decided to alter significant portions of the original proposal. The subject will remain the same and so will the medium of video, but the content will no longer be original writing. Instead, I plan to construct a video composed of composited segments of interviews from many different kinds of people, all with different backgrounds.

My main goal is to capture authenticity. I am aiming to get to the root of people's thoughts and/or fears pertaining to the subject of mortality. To do so, I will aim for a more informal interview style, where the cameras are simply there to observe the scene.

Whether or not to include my own voice is something still up for debate, but I plan to approach these interviews as conversations simply being recorded. Ideally, I would like to exclude my own voice in editing, while still maintaining a conversation style for the actual recording. I have also considered some sort of animated title-screen. If neither of these methods prove fruitful, I may even look into some voice over options.

Going forward I will try to capture at least some audio from a few friends to determine the viability of the project. My current thinking is that if I can get some compelling content out of a friend in audio, I should be able to do the same with others on video.
