<span class="dropcap">A</span>fter having shoot a handful of interviews, I am starting to get a better idea of what works and what does not work from an interviewer's perspective. One of the main challenges is splitting the difference between capturing authenticity of an unscripted conversation and having a consistent set of questions for all interviewees to provide structure for the final edit. I have adopted a short list of very open-ended questions to "get the ball rolling" and break the subject into the subject of their own mortality. With these questions in place, I find that by listening to the responses carefully, there are usually follow-up questions that are made evident that serve to transition into some of the more personal and unique content I am hoping to coax out. Although, as one might expect, this has proven easier to do for some people that for others, I haven't had one interview yet that is completely unusable.

Going forward, my primary concern will be getting new interviews. Another note for editing that I am making is that using two cameras could save me some grief down the road.
