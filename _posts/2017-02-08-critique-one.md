<p><span class="dropcap">F</span>or critique one I was hoping to explore the viability of my project; after all, if you are going to spend an entire semester on one project, you'd better make sure it's going to work out! I invited a good friend over for drinks and we sat down to discuss some of the issues outlined in my project proposal. The interview, if you can call it an interview, was extremely casual; more like a conversation with me probing him on certain issues. I have to say, while not entirely succinct, the recording contained a level of authenticity I hoped for but had not really expected.

After playing the conversation back, I felt confident that I had captured some really compelling material, and was happy to include it in the Crit. I was not so happy, however, when I played some cherry-picked sections during class. The sound-bites that I had chosen seemed totally disjointed from each other, and the message was in danger of being totally lost. It was then I discovered how important editing would be to the project. I believe it was the context of each comment that made them compelling when I picked them out.

Another observation from the Critique I found helpful was being made aware of the possibility for the project to become "stoner talk," which I took to mean falling into the realm of platitude. This is certainly something I hope to avoid. Perhaps the key to doing so lies in procuring the largest possible representative sample I can find when It comes to interviews. It will be important to gather a large range of opinions on the topic.</p>

Going forward, I hope to gather some worthwhile interviews on video for the next critique. I want to experiment with a couple of different interview tactics; formal and informal, lighting, location, etc.
