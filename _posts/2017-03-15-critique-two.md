<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>hile our second critique was canceled, I got a good bit of advice from the individual meetings the week before, not to mention an excuse to watch some excellent documentaries, namely *Grizzley Man* directed by Werner Herzog and *Man on Wire* directed by James Marsh, and a couple of others. Both were absolutely wonderful. My excuse to see these films comes from the realization that my project is essentially a documentary piece. I'll admit, it seems silly to have arrived at this conclusion so far into the project, but having done so has provided the project with some much needed direction. The editing process has really just begun, and there is much more I would hope to shoot. As such, the film could still take many forms as the editing stage progresses, I would hope to study and emulate some of the techniques that successful film makers have employed to effectively tell their stories.

The questions of b-roll and voice-overs still require answers. The subject-matter of the interviews tends to be abstract and quite varied, so finding suitable b-roll is definitely going to be a challenge. For the voice-over, I would like to find someone other than myself to actually introduce the project in the beginning of the film.
