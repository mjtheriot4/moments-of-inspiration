<h2>Theme:</h2>
<p>The existential fear of dying; defining this fear in personal, societal and philosophical contexts with the goal of better understanding the incomprehensible: our own bodily demise. This topic is of acute and reluctant import to me personally and has been for some time now. As such, I understand this topic better, perhaps, even than I would like to. Furthermore, I believe that the topic is relevant, as it must at least be physically (if not consciously) be confronted by literally everyone that has, and will ever live.</p>
<h2>Methods/Medium:</h2>
<p>The final rendering of my project will take the form of a “video essay.” Because there seems to be some debate on what that term means, I will define it as follows: a short video (5 – 7 minutes) that utilizes narration as a primary means of conveying the message of the piece that is supported by a mix of visual assets. Among these visual assets, at least some (perhaps most) of them will be original footage of my own. Other assets will include found/stock footage, audio assets, original motion graphics and/or animation.
The essay will contain sections of concept and sections of examples, the latter of which I hope to play out in film to accompany the narrated explanation. For the conceptual sections, I hope to make use of montage sequences and informative/creative motion graphics.</p><p>
For the editing, I will primarily be using Adobe Premiere Pro. Audio will be edited and mastered via Adobe Audition. Voice over will also be captured using Adobe Audition. Most of the motion graphics will be created and composed in after effects, with any 3D assets being rendered out of Autodesk’s Maya. As for hardware, video and audio equipment will be requisitioned as needed from the CxC.</p>
