title: "Community and Semester Goals"

<p class="intro"> With this decidedly idiosyncratic definition of "community" out of the way, I'd like to spend a few lines of text describing mine:</p>

My community is one that loves TED talks and Podcasts, gets excited about new technology, is interested in things like the ever evolving web, appreciates production value and cinematography

of *some* Netflix original series, and is more than a little curious about something (or anything). This is not an exhaustive list; it's more like a random sampling of qualities that one might find among the members of my community.

If I had to outline one one minimum criterium for membership to this community it would be simply to have a desire to produce something worth looking at. During this semester of college, this is my overall goal, and I believe that pursuing this wholeheartedly I can stand out in my community. Although it will be difficult at times, I believe that most things that are worth doing are difficult, and I am ready to get started.

One of the things I have always loved about the Digital Art program is the incredible diversity that it affords it's graduates in the professional world. Whether its animation, CG, web development, graphic design or film and video, there are a multitude of fields open to a digital artist.

Ironically, the same openness that makes this program inherently diverse also makes it intrinsically difficult to specialize in. In my view, the digital artist specializes by choosing a community to become a part of. Whether consciously or unconsciously, we define the communities to which we aspire to belong by our interests, skills, and curiosity.
